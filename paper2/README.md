    abstract: >
        As the world becomes more technologically advanced, more and more work is being
        done on computers digitally versus in the real world physically. This shift in
        how work is done is creating a situation where huge swaths of people are sitting
        down for longer periods of time than is medically recommended for healthy living.
        For many, this has created the need for more exercise and athleticism than what
        one typically gets in a normal day. This occupational atrophy is one of the
        driving forces in the development of technology that monitors and datafies the
        user's day-to-day physical activity and vital signs. All this new data being
        created is helping make improvements in the lives of those with sedentary jobs,
        while also revealing new techniques and applications for already existing training
        or exercise programs. The data is being generated at an increasing rate from the
        growing number of users who track their activity with the use of sports trackers,
        smart clothing or athletic wear, and mobile phones. The applications of this data
        are not limited to improving the health of office workers and other employees
        whose jobs or lives require low physical activity. The datafication of physical
        fitness and activity is also changing the way professional athletes and coaches
        approach their training regiments, as well as having military applications in
        regards to training personnel.
