        Social media has changed the way people get information, disseminate
        information, communicate, and stay in touch with others,
        both online and in the real world. As more and more people from
        different age groups and socioeconomic backgrounds begin adopting
        social media and becoming active users, data is being created at a
        geometric rate. The analysis of all this data being generated can be
        used in a myriad of different ways, including nefarious ones. It is
        possible to analyze the digital footprint of social media users in
        order to accurately target enormous swaths of a population with
        propaganda, misinformation, and deception which have been created to
        cater to the specific population's social or political bias.
