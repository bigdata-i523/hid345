    title: Big Data Dangers: Weaponizing Social Media
    abstract: >
        Social media has changed the way people get information, disseminate
        information, communicate, and stay in touch with others,
        both online and in the real world. As more and more people from
        different age groups and socioeconomic backgrounds begin adopting
        social media and becoming active users, data is being created at a
        geometric rate. The analysis of all this data being generated can be
        used in a myriad of different ways, including nefarious ones. It is
        possible to analyze the digital footprint of social media users in
        order to accurately target enormous swaths of a population with
        propaganda, misinformation, and deception which have been created to
        cater to the specific population's social or political bias.

    title: How the Datafication of Activity is Improving Human Health
    abstract: >
        As the world becomes more technologically advanced, more and more work is 
        being done on computers digitally versus in the real world physically. This 
        shift in how work is done is creating a situation where huge swaths of people 
        are sitting down for longer periods of time than is medically recommended 
        for healthy living. For many, this has created the need for more exercise 
        and athleticism than what one typically gets in a normal day. This 
        occupational atrophy is one of the driving forces in the development of 
        technology that monitors and generates data of the user's day-to-day physical 
        activity and vital signs. All this new data being created is helping make 
        improvements in the lives of those with sedentary jobs, while also revealing 
        new techniques and applications for already existing training or exercise 
        programs. The data is being generated at an increasing rate from the growing 
        number of users who track their activity with the use of sports trackers, 
        smart clothing or athletic wear, and mobile phones. The applications of 
        this data are not limited to improving the health of office workers and other 
        employees whose jobs or lives require low physical activity. The datafication 
        of physical fitness and activity is also changing the way professional 
        athletes and coaches approach their training regiments, as well as having 
        military applications in regards to training personnel.
